A key phrase to look into is "monocular SLAM".  It is what is used by tum Ardrone library.

Monocular slam doesn't work unless you have some other source of data (such as a altimeter) which can let you resolve scale.

PTAM was developed to provide pose estimation in small scenes (released with a GPL license).  It would appear the work has been extended to allow its use in large outdoor scenes with quadcopters.
