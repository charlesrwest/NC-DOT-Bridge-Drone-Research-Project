A key phrase to look into is "monocular SLAM".  It is what is used by tum Ardrone library.

Monocular slam doesn't work unless you have some other source of data (such as a altimeter) which can let you resolve scale.

PTAM was developed to provide pose estimation in small scenes (released with a GPL license).  It would appear the work has been extended to allow its use in large outdoor scenes with quadcopters.

It looks like it might be possible to robustly position a monocular camera relative to a QR code if the QR code embeds is physical size in its text and the zbar code allows determination of orientation (which points correspond to which corners).

Zbar appears to be consistent in the ordering of the rectangle vertices of a detected QR code, so it would be suitable to be used with the 4 point algorithm to obtain the transform of the camera using opencv.

It looks like mouse sensors can be used for odometry if a different lense is used to change what range they use.
