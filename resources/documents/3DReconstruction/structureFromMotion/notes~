CMVS/PMVS2 seem to be open source libraries that provide multi view reconstruction.  However, they appear to rely on the SIFT algorithm which they claim is copyrighted (need to check).

VisualSFM appears to put the packages together in such a way that you can use a GUI to make a 3D scene from images.  Processing each image appears to take on the order of 5-10 seconds (scaling time unknown).  It should be possible to take a normal hand held recording to check the feasiblity/reconstruction accuracy of the algorithm.

At a 30 frames per second and constant scaling, it would require 150 hrs to 300 hrs per hr of video to be processed (though parallelization might be possible).
