Get ChibiOS working on a USB compatible microcontroller.

Get a good PTAM calibration for my webcam and the gopro.  Make sure that the gopro calibration matches the gopro used for testing sequences.

Get ROS style camera calibration for the gopro and see if it can be used with the live version of LSDSlam.

Get ROS style camera calibration for the AR drone.  See if that helps it fly better/not go out of control as much.

Check shoving motion for the AR drone.

Determine how the GUI program is controlling the quadcopter and how my ROS node could take control of it.



Completed:
Created a high resolution checker board to be plotted for easier camera calibrations (especially for flying drones).

Determined how to make sped up (reduced frames) versions of video to ensure that PTAM calibration can be done in a resonable time.

Removed video files from github repository history and created .gitignore files to make sure that git will ignore any future video files.

Rewired PTAM camera calibrator so that it works with recorded video instead of just grabbing the first video device on the computer.

Fixed PTAM camera calibrator so that it would take video files of an abritrary size, rather than cropping them to a (too small) size.
